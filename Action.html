            1. Prevent Bird Collisions with Your Windows  Collisions are one of the most frequent causes of bird deaths. Birds see nature reflected in the window or mistake houseplants inside the building for outdoor plants and fly into the glass. Putting up curtains or window decals helps make the window visible to birds.

<br>  2. Protect Birds From Pets  Unleashed dogs and outdoor cats can harm birds by disturbing, chasing, and even killing them. Keeping your cat indoors and your dog from straying saves millions of birds each year.   
 
 <br> 3. Clean Your Bird Feeders  Dirty feeders can spread disease. Disinfect and clean out old seed from feeders frequently and put fresh water in your bird bath every day.
 
<br>  4. Donâ€™t Buy Illegally-Caged Birds  Selling wild-caught birds as pets is illegal. Buy only captive-bred birds. Make certain that the breeder or pet store is reputable.

 <br> 5. Use Cloth Grocery Bags and Reusable Bottles   Birds that mistakenly eat plastic trash can become ill or even die. Avoiding plastic bags and bottles reduces plastic pollution and conserves resources.
 
 <br>  6. Recycle  Anything you recycle reduces litter and saves resources. Get creative! You can make a bag from used juice containers and bird feeders from old dishes and plastic bottles. 
 
  <br> 7. Restore Natural Habitat in Your Community  Birds need a place to live and many bird habitats are disappearing. City parks and open spaces are natural places for birds.  Work with your community to recreate the habitat that once existed in your area.
 
<br> 8. Keep Your Distance  Birds need space for feeding, nesting, and other daily activities. Approaching too closely may cause them to become nervous and deplete much-needed energy reserves.  During the nesting season, it may even result in loss of eggs or young to predators.

<br> 9. Leave Fledglings Where You Find Them  Fledglings may spend several days on the ground after they leave the nest before they are able to fly. You can help by keeping people and pets away, so their parents can continue to care for them. If you think a bird is truly an orphan, call a rehabilitator for instructions. 

 <br>   10.Reduce Energy Use  Riding your bike or walking reduces your carbon footprint and prevents pollution of bird habitats. Switching off the lights in your house not only shrinks your energy bill, but can also help prevent birds from colliding with your windows.
