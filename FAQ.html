        <ul><li><h2>What is migration?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>Migration is the cyclic or periodic travel of an animal as it returns eventually to its original place of departure. Migration is often annual and is closely linked with the cyclic pattern of the seasons. It is most evident among birds, which have a highly efficient means for traveling swiftly over long distances. The migration of most birds is a yearly cycle.</p>
        <ul><li><h2>Do all birds migrate?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>Not all birds migrate. The more severe the climate of an area, the greater percentage of nesting birds migrate. Two-thirds of bird species found in the United States migrate, some only short distances to more southern states. Those that do migrate have adaptations not seen in their non-migratory relatives. Migratory birds can build fat stores as an energy source for long flights. Migratory birds usually have longer, more pointed wings and weigh less than related non-migratory birds.</p>
        <ul><li><h2>Why do birds migrate?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>There are a number of explanations for migration. (1) Birds migrate to areas where food is more abundant, (2) there is less competition for nesting space, (3) the climate is milder, or (4) the daylight hours are longer. These enhance the chances of survival of a bird and its brood. Most birds require a rich, abundant supply of food at frequent intervals because of their high metabolic rate. Adequate food is not available throughout the year in most regions. North American birds must endure the hazards of winter or migrate to more friendly climates. In winter they migrate to the warmer, southern regions of the United States, Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and South America where food is abundant. In the spring, these birds fly north to habitats where spring and summer provide more food production and less competition for food and nesting sites than in their winter habitat. Summertime at northern latitudes also means more daylight hours to seek food for themselves and their nestlings.</p>
        <ul><li><h2>Where do migrating birds go?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>Many nesting birds in Canada and the northern United States fly south to the tier of states along the Gulf of Mexico where the winter climate is more favorable and food is abundant. More than 300 species of birds that nest in the United States and Canada migrate to the West Indies or Central and South America. The principal wintering area for Neotropical Migrants extends through Mexico and Central America to Panama; it has the highest density of winter bird residents in the world.</p>
        <ul><li><h2>How far do migrating birds travel?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>Migration usually involves latitudinal or altitudinal travel. The distance may be a few miles or thousands of miles. In mountainous areas, birds, mammals and others move just a few miles from upper zones where they breed to the foothills or plains during seasons when the weather is severe and unfavorable. Clark's Nutcracker, for example, of the Rocky Mountains nests in the summer high in the mountains then winters in the lower forests.The seasonal flights of American wood warblers are spectacular. Some winter in the Gulf States and the West Indies; others fly as far south as Guyana, Brazil and Peru. Tanagers and Bobolinks migrate through the eastern United States, past Cuba to southern Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina.

        <ul><li><h2>How fast do migrating birds fly?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>The speed of flight depends largely on the species and the type of terrain covered. Birds fly faster when migrating than otherwise. Birds seem to fly faster in spring migration than in the fall. Migrants fly faster over water than over land. The American Golden-Plover may fly over 2400 miles south over the Atlantic Ocean at nearly 60 mph. Common Loons are among the fastest flyers at nearly 70 mph. Woodcocks on the other hand, fly at just over 10 miles per hour. Birds migrating over land may make stops for food and rest.</p>
        <ul><li><h2>How high do migrating birds fly?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>Most migrants fly at low altitudes, usually below 7400 feet. Small birds migrating at night fly between 800-1600 feet. In the daytime they fly much lower, often below 200 feet. Some fly much higher, the record is held by the Bar-headed Goose: 29,500 feet above sea level, over the Himalayas in India.
        </p>
        <ul><li><h2>How high do migrating birds fly?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>Swift, strong fliers and hunters are often daytime, or diurnal migrants. These include pelicans, herons, birds of prey, hummingbirds, swifts, swallows and finches. Some of these birds can feed on the wing.</p>
        <ul><li><h2>How are migratory birds important to man?</h2></li></ul><br>
        <p>Migratory birds have considerable economic impact in North America. Since European settlers first came to the New World, they hunted various birds, such as ducks and geese, rails, doves and shorebirds, for food and sport. During the late 19th century, many species were hunted to near extinction for the market as food and feathers for adornment on women's hats. As their numbers dwindled, controls and seasons were instituted to stop their decline and stabilize the populations. Laws established to protect nongame birds and regulate hunting of game birds include the Migratory Bird Treaties mentioned above. Today, regulated hunting is a major industry in many areas of the United States. Most nongame birds were recognized to be welcome allies against insect pests. Most of the migratory birds of North America are insect eaters. Healthy, stable populations of these "songbirds" help to keep insect pests within tolerable limits. There are numerous instances where flocks of birds have descended on areas threatened with disastrous insect infestations and virtually eliminated the threat. All birds have increasing recreational value as birdwatching and other forms of nature related activities become more popular. Ecotourism, including birdwatching, camping, hiking, nature study and photography have become part of a multi-billion dollar industry. Throughout the United States, more people are engaged in nature tourism than either hunting or fishing. Together, hunting, fishing, and ecotourism are part of an industry that is worth over $100 billion annually in the United Sates alone. It pays in many ways to protect and maintain our natural assets.</p><br>
