        <h2>MIGRATION AROUND WORLD</h2>
        <h3>The migration routes of migrant birds in all the world. There are eight migratory routes for birds in the world. Three routes of them pass by China: purple line, orange line and blue line. Light green region represents China and Red star represents the location of H7N9 outbreak, which is the Yangtze river delta area. World map is drawn by Matlab R2009a. China map is drawn by ArcGIS 10. Lines and red star are added by Microsoft Office Word 2003.</h3>

        <h2>MIGRATION AROUND MEXICO</h2>
        <h3> Lash a Lilliputian knapsack to the back of a wild songbird called a Swainson’s thrush, release the bird to begin its grueling 8,000-mile round-trip migration, and then return a year later to the exact same spot in the vast Canadian forest to await the bird’s return and retrieve its miniature luggage, which holds a tracking device. “To our great surprise, we actually succeeded,” says Darren Irwin, a University of British Columbia ornithologist. His team, led by PhD student Kira Delmore, collected dozens of the devices as part of a startling new study that provides the strongest evidence to date that certain genes govern avian migration patterns—and may also guide the mass movements of creatures from butterflies to wildebeests.</h3>

        <h2>MIGRATION AROUND INDIA</h2>
        <h3>Since 2014, Bird Count India has been encouraging Indian birders to upload their bird lists to eBird, and this has resulted in hugely increased amounts of information becoming publicly available.

            With the increased volume of information, how does the Pied Cuckoo-and-monsoon story look? Using sightings accumulated until 2017, MD Madhusudan revisited the Pied Cuckoo question and created this wonderful animation showing how Pied Cuckoo sightings (red dots) and rain (grey-blue regions) are related: a further demonstration of the truth behind the folklore that the species heralds the monsoon rains.</h3>

        <h2>MIGRATION AROUND SOUTH EAST ASIA</h2>
        <h3>In this study, we tested whether Common Redshanks and Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from Singapore migrate across the Himalayas. We used light-level geolocators and satellite transmitters to track migrations of both species. Based on existing knowledge we expected that most individuals would migrate along more easterly routes but we aimed to (1) document whether any individuals made a more westerly crossing of the Himalayas; (2) determine whether any individuals avoided the Himalayas by making a detour around them; and (3) describe the relative migration patterns in terms of the general migration metrics, timings and stopovers for birds making trans-Himalayan flights versus those that did not.</h3>
